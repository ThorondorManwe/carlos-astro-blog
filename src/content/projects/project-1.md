This was my first official job as a web developer. To this day I am very grateful to the State Electoral Institute of Aguascalientes for giving me the opportunity to test my skills, improve my knowledge, learn new technologies such as Next.js and meet great professionals who would later become friends.

In this project, the [Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares 2024](https://prep2024.ieeags.mx/ayuntamientos) or “PREP” I was supporting the person in charge of the Front End part of the application. When I arrived they told me that I had to learn Next.js to contribute to the project and since I only knew React at that time I had to delve into this framework.

Some of my responsibilities were:

- Creation of components to use in the FrontEnd application
- Implementation of components that integrate technologies such as jQuery to show the map of votes by district and municipality and
- Creation of general use components such as a search bar and filters for selectors.

They were interesting months of challenges in which I learned to consume data from the endpoints that the Django Backend gave us and we also had meetings with the mobile developers in charge of the application made with React Native.

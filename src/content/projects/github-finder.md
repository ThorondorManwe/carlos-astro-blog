I did this project as part of Brad Traversy's [React Front To Back Course](https://www.traversymedia.com/Modern-React-Front-To-Back-Course). It was very interesting because after having learned React through documentation, taking other courses and simple exercises, I was looking to create more complex projects and this course gave me the opportunity to learn how to create this type of web applications.
For this I used TailwindCSS and Daisy UI and I created the components, first the Navbar, then the Footer and for navigation I used React Router.

Then I connected the project to GitHub with the API through my token. I created components to show the list of users, the profile of each user, the functionality to clean the results of a search and the fetching of users.

Here I put into practice the React hook called useReducer that would serve me later in my professional life.

[I deployed the application in Vercel](https://github-finder-sand-five.vercel.app/).

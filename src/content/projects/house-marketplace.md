For this project I used Firebase to store the data. I first made the components like the Navbar with dummy data and then implemented Firebase data.

I implemented a form for Sign in and Sign Up, and then saved the user information in Firestore. For alerts I implemented Toastify and made a component for private routes.

Finally I implemented the functionality to log in with Google through Google OAuth.

[I deployed the application in Vercel](https://house-marketplace-roan-nine.vercel.app/).

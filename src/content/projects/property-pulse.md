This is an interesting project because it is an application that has FrontEnd components but also has Backend functionality, it allows the user to save properties for sale or rent and log in with Google.

It is an application that I made as part of Brad Traversy's [Next.js From Scratch 2024](https://www.traversymedia.com/nextjs-from-scratch) course to learn the basics of Next.js and get to work on the IEEA application in my first job as a FrontEnd developer. I took this course at the same time that I started creating components for the PREP application because since it is essentially React, it becomes simple for those of us who know this library.

The landing page of the course says: “Learn Next.js by building a full-featured property rental server-side rendered website from the ground up” and I think it fulfills that because in the end I managed to feel very comfortable using Next.js and as a React developer in general.

Some of the skills I learned while making this application:

- Create SSR websites with Next.js
- React Server Components & Server Actions
- MongoDB, Mongoose for database interaction
- Next Auth & Google provider for authentication
- User profiles with listing management
- Cloudinary Image integration
- Implement Bookmarking, maps, pagination, sharing
- Create nternal messaging system for communication

[I deployed the application in Vercel](https://property-pulse-sable.vercel.app/).
